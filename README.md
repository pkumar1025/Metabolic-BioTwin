- **Sleep Impact Forecasting**: Predict how sleep quality affects next-day metabolic markers
- **7-Day Health Forecast**: Trend-based predictions for key health metrics

### 🎯 **Personalized Health Scoring**
- **Comprehensive Scoring**: Glucose control, sleep quality, recovery (HRV), nutrition, and activity
- **Trend Analysis**: Track improvements or declines in each health domain
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Priority-based suggestions with expected impact

### 🔍 **Advanced Anomaly Detection**
- **Statistical Detection**: Rolling median + MAD for robust anomaly identification
- **Contextual Alerts**: Link anomalies to historical patterns and potential causes
- **Intervention Suggestions**: Specific actions to address detected issues

### 📈 **Unified Health Dashboard**
- **Holistic Timeline**: Correlated view of sleep, activity, nutrition, and vitals
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Beautiful, responsive charts with trend analysis
- **Real-time Insights**: Dynamic updates as new data is ingested
