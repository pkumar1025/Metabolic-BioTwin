### Known Issues
- **File Upload**: Individual file upload functionality still needs to be fixed and tested

## Technical Approach & Design Choices

### Why This Technical Stack?

**Backend: FastAPI + Python**
- **Chosen over**: Flask (less type safety), Django (overkill for API), Node.js (less ML ecosystem)
- **Reasoning**: FastAPI provides automatic API documentation, type safety, and excellent performance for data-heavy applications. Python's ML ecosystem (pandas, scikit-learn) integrates seamlessly.

**Frontend: Plotly Dash**
- **Chosen over**: React (requires separate backend/frontend), Streamlit (less customizable), Vue.js (more complex setup)
- **Reasoning**: Dash integrates directly with Python data science stack, eliminating the need for separate frontend/backend development. Perfect for data visualization with minimal code.

**Data Processing: Local vs Cloud**
- **Chosen**: Local processing on user's device
- **Chosen over**: Cloud processing (AWS, Google Cloud)
- **Reasoning**: Health data privacy is paramount. Users maintain complete control over sensitive metabolic data. No data transmission means no privacy risks.

### Why These AI Methods?

**Random Forest for Glucose Prediction**
- **Chosen over**: Neural Networks (overkill for tabular data), Linear Regression (too simple), XGBoost (similar performance, more complex)
- **Reasoning**: Health decisions require interpretable AI. Random Forest provides feature importance rankings, handles non-linear relationships, and works well with small datasets typical in personal health data.

**Statistical Correlation Analysis**
- **Chosen over**: Deep Learning pattern recognition, Time series analysis
- **Reasoning**: Health insights must be trustworthy and explainable. Statistical methods provide confidence intervals, significance testing, and clear interpretation - essential for health decision-making.

**Doubly Robust Estimation for Causal Inference**
- **Chosen over**: Simple correlation analysis, Propensity score matching
- **Reasoning**: Health decisions require understanding true cause-and-effect, not just correlation. Doubly robust estimation handles confounding variables and provides reliable causal estimates even with model misspecification.

**Local Data Science Libraries**
- **Chosen over**: External AI APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic), Cloud ML services
- **Reasoning**: Privacy-first approach with complete user control. Traditional libraries (scikit-learn, scipy) provide interpretable results without data leaving the user's device.

### Why This Implementation Path?

**CSV Upload System**
- **Chosen over**: Direct API integration (Apple HealthKit, Google Fit), Database integration
- **Reasoning**: Health data comes from many different sources with varying formats. CSV provides maximum compatibility while maintaining privacy. Works with any health device without API dependencies.

**Flexible Column Recognition**
- **Chosen over**: Fixed column names, User-specified mapping
- **Reasoning**: Real-world health data is messy. Different devices use different naming conventions. Intelligent parsing handles this automatically, improving user experience.

### Design Philosophy
- **Privacy-First**: User data never leaves their device
- **Interpretable AI**: Health decisions require explainable, trustworthy insights
- **Flexible Data**: Handles real-world data messiness from various health devices
- **User-Centric**: Complex data presented in accessible, actionable formats
