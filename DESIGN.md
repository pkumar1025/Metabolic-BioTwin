### Known Issues
- **File Upload**: Individual file upload functionality still needs to be fixed and tested

## Technical Decision Rationale & Tradeoffs

### Architecture Decisions

#### Why FastAPI + Plotly Dash?
**Decision**: FastAPI backend with Plotly Dash frontend
**Alternatives Considered**: 
- Flask + React (more flexible but slower development)
- Django + Vue.js (more complex for data-heavy app)
- Streamlit (simpler but less customizable)

**Tradeoffs**:
- **Pros**: FastAPI provides automatic API documentation, type safety, and excellent performance. Dash integrates seamlessly with Python data science stack.
- **Cons**: Less frontend flexibility than React, limited to Python-based UI components
- **Rationale**: For a data-heavy health application, the tight integration between backend ML and frontend visualization outweighed the frontend flexibility limitations.

#### Why Local Processing vs. Cloud?
**Decision**: All data processing happens locally on user's device
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Cloud-based processing (AWS, Google Cloud)
- Hybrid approach (local + cloud)

**Tradeoffs**:
- **Pros**: Complete privacy protection, no data transmission, user control, no ongoing costs
- **Cons**: Limited computational power, no cloud ML services, harder to scale, requires local installation
- **Rationale**: Health data privacy is paramount. Users should have complete control over their sensitive metabolic data.

#### Why CSV Upload vs. API Integration?
**Decision**: Flexible CSV upload with column name recognition
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Direct API integration (Apple HealthKit, Google Fit)
- Database integration
- Real-time streaming

**Tradeoffs**:
- **Pros**: Works with any health device, no API dependencies, handles data format variations, privacy-first
- **Cons**: Manual upload process, no real-time sync, limited to batch processing
- **Rationale**: Health data comes from many different sources with varying formats. CSV provides maximum compatibility while maintaining privacy.

### Machine Learning Decisions

#### Why Random Forest for Glucose Prediction?
**Decision**: Random Forest for glucose response prediction
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Linear Regression (too simple for non-linear relationships)
- Neural Networks (overkill for this data size)
- XGBoost (more complex, similar performance)

**Tradeoffs**:
- **Pros**: Handles non-linear relationships, robust to outliers, provides feature importance, interpretable results
- **Cons**: Less sophisticated than deep learning, limited to tabular data
- **Rationale**: Health data is inherently interpretable and requires explainable AI. Random Forest provides good performance with clear feature importance.

#### Why Doubly Robust Estimation for Causal Inference?
**Decision**: Doubly robust estimation for treatment effects
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Simple correlation analysis
- Propensity score matching
- Instrumental variables

**Tradeoffs**:
- **Pros**: More robust than simple correlations, handles confounding variables, provides causal estimates
- **Cons**: More complex implementation, requires larger sample sizes, computationally intensive
- **Rationale**: Health decisions require understanding causality, not just correlation. Doubly robust estimation provides reliable causal estimates even with model misspecification.

#### Why Statistical Correlation Analysis vs. Deep Learning?
**Decision**: Spearman/Pearson correlation with confidence intervals
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Deep learning pattern recognition
- Time series analysis
- Clustering algorithms

**Tradeoffs**:
- **Pros**: Interpretable results, statistical significance testing, confidence intervals, works with small datasets
- **Cons**: Limited to linear relationships, requires statistical knowledge to interpret
- **Rationale**: Health insights need to be trustworthy and interpretable. Statistical methods provide clear confidence measures and are more reliable for health decisions.

### Data Processing Decisions

#### Why Flexible Column Name Recognition?
**Decision**: Intelligent CSV parsing that recognizes various column naming conventions
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Fixed column names
- User-specified column mapping
- Machine learning column detection

**Tradeoffs**:
- **Pros**: Works with any CSV format, user-friendly, handles real-world data messiness
- **Cons**: More complex code, potential for misidentification, requires extensive testing
- **Rationale**: Health data comes from many different sources with varying formats. Flexibility is essential for real-world usability.

#### Why Multi-dimensional Health Scoring?
**Decision**: Composite scoring across glucose, sleep, recovery, nutrition, and activity
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single health score
- Individual metric tracking
- Machine learning-based scoring

**Tradeoffs**:
- **Pros**: Comprehensive health view, actionable insights, easy to understand
- **Cons**: Subjective weighting, potential for oversimplification, requires domain expertise
- **Rationale**: Users need a holistic view of their health. Multi-dimensional scoring provides actionable insights while maintaining interpretability.

### Implementation Challenges & Solutions

#### Challenge: Data Integration Complexity
**Problem**: Every health device uses different formats and column names
**Solution**: Built flexible CSV parser with column name recognition
**Tradeoff**: More complex code vs. maximum compatibility
**Learning**: Real-world data is messier than expected. Flexibility is more important than elegance.

#### Challenge: Statistical Rigor vs. User Experience
**Problem**: Balancing advanced statistics with user-friendly insights
**Solution**: Used confidence intervals and significance testing, but presented in plain language
**Tradeoff**: More complex implementation vs. more trustworthy results
**Learning**: Users need both accuracy and accessibility. Technical sophistication should enhance, not complicate, the user experience.

#### Challenge: Privacy vs. Functionality
**Problem**: Maintaining privacy while providing powerful AI insights
**Solution**: Local processing with no data transmission
**Tradeoff**: Limited computational power vs. complete privacy protection
**Learning**: For health data, privacy is not negotiable. Functionality must work within privacy constraints.

#### Challenge: Model Validation with Limited Data
**Problem**: Health data is often limited and personal
**Solution**: Used bootstrap confidence intervals and significance testing
**Tradeoff**: Less robust validation vs. working with available data
**Learning**: Health data is inherently personal and limited. Validation methods must be appropriate for the data size and context.

### Future Technical Considerations
